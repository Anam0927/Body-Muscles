# Muscles of the Body - A Log Diary #

## Log 1 - Beginning from an End ##

I got this project as a freelancer on Fiverr. On paper, it sounds pretty simple. Just make it so that different muscle groups of a human body get highlighted on hover and also, show some details related to it. 

But, this being my **first** professional (*actual*) web dev project, I made a lot of mistakes.  

Most importantly though, I ***learnt*** a lot! <ins>Experience</ins> is what I gained. So, all in all, I enjoyed it quite a lot.

My first attempt at the project is at *[here]https://anam0927.github.io/Muscles-of-the-Body)*.
There are a number of problems with this:  

1. #### Color Palette ####

   I'm not sure why I wanted to use this color palette, but I did. It feels a little dull though.
   
   -<ins>**Lesson Learnt**</ins>: Decide at least a couple of color palette beforehand rather than trying various palettes during actual coding. It only diverts attention and wastes a lot of time.

2. #### UI ####
  
   Although the idea of having a side menu was nice, I think I can do better. I'm still thinking of various layouts (maybe a top menu, or a slide-in menu?), but I'd like to change the current one.

    ##### *WIREFRAME!* #####

3. #### Responsiveness ####

   With my current code, I can't seem to make it responsive easily. Basically, that means my code could've been more simple. That's what I'm aiming for now!

   -<ins>**Lesson Learnt**</ins>: Write simpler code.

4. #### Code Documentation ####

   Finally, documentation! I initially thought that I'll document my code after I complete the project.  
   ***Big Mistake!***  
   Documentation makes debugging easier and also, updation. Although I had read these facts before, I foolishly ignored it. Not gonna do that anymore!  
   ***Comments, here I come!***

That's it for now! Let's see how the second version turn out to be!
